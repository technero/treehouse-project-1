        <h1>Egyptian souq</h1>
        <p><em>Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era
                and named for one of its several historic caravanserais,
                the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main
                attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike.
                It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops
                involved in the production of traditional crafts and
                souvenirs.</em></p>
